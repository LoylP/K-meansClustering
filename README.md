# K-meansClustering
K-means is the most popular method for clustering, which is partition-based.

Data representation: D = {x1, x2, â€¦, xr}, each xi is a vector in the n-dimensional Euclidean space.

K-means partitions D into K clusters:
Each cluster has a central point which is called centroid.
K is a pre-specified constant.
